# Fisher

Fisher is a **repainting** custom indicator for MT4 and MT5 coded by EarnForex.com. It was originally developed by Yuri Prokofiev. In theory, it allows rather accurate trend and reversal detection. In practice, its repainting nature makes it not so useful.

You can change the main input parameter (**Period**) to regulate its sensitivity to the changing market conditions.
